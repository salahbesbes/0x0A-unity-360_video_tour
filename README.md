# 0x0A-unity-360_video_tour
A video tour set in Holberton School San Francesco campus for Google Cardboard with interactable hotspots and textboxes.<br><br>
This is my first VR unity project. I tried developing it with both the Oculus Quest headset and the Google Cardboard, but it worked best with the Google Cardboard because I ran into many bugs and problems with the Quest headset.<br><br>
